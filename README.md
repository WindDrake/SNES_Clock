# SNES_Clock
 Nintendo SNES SHVC-CPU-01 Clock Buffer

 Design done in Kicad 5.1.10 with Digikey libraries. If you want to edit it, you'll need those libraries as well as these files.

 The purpose of this board is to fix FXPak/SD2SNES issues with SHVC-CPU-01-based SNES consoles. The original clock driver on these PCB's is extremely load sensitive.
 
 Tested via deadbugging, this workaround does solve the glitches with the aforementioned carts.

 Installation instructions & pictures coming soon, once boards arrive. (9/3/21)
